## Introduction
The player can select a difficulty that will change the game rules. Easy will allow the snake to wrap through the walls. Medium will end the game if a player hits a wall. Hard will end the game if a player hits a will, and will increase the snakes speed each time a piece of fruit is eaten. Players can choose snake speed, and if they want to have obstacles, rocks, in the playing area.
